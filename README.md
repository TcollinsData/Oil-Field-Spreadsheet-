# Oilfield Equipment Cost & Maintenance Tracker (Excel Project)

## 📁 Project Overview
This Excel-based project analyzes oilfield equipment data to track usage, calculate operational costs, and schedule maintenance. It’s designed to support better decision-making around cost control and equipment reliability.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
  - Pivot Tables
  - Formulas (Total Cost = Hours Used × Cost per Hour)

## 📊 What’s in the File
The spreadsheet includes:
- Equipment ID & Type
- Hours Used
- Cost per Hour and Total Cost
- Maintenance Dates (Last & Next)
- Equipment Status (e.g., Active, Inactive, Needs Repair)
- Summary Pivot Table for cost by equipment type

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Drill Rig** has the highest cost at $3,000, accounting for over 50% of total equipment expenses.
- Maintenance dates are clustered in **May–June 2025**, presenting a risk of overlapping downtime.
- One unit (Compressor) is flagged **“Needs Repair”**, suggesting a need for preventive maintenance planning.

## ✅ Skills Demonstrated
- Excel data organization and cleanup
- Cost calculation and operational analysis
- Pivot Table creation for category-level summaries
- Practical decision-making based on maintenance data

## 📍Use Case
This project simulates how analysts in energy or field operations could use Excel to manage equipment and reduce downtime or unnecessary costs.
